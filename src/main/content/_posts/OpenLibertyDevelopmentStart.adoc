## Step A: [Install and setup the required software](OpenLiberty-Start-Step-A)

[Installing Bnd Tools for your eclipse workspace](http://bndtools.org/installation.html)

Since your eclipse workspace will be rather large, it is necessary to increase the max heap size.  You can do this in the $ECLIPSE_INSTALL_HOME/eclipse.ini file. <br>
For OpenLiberty eclipse use at least: `-Xmx2048m`<br>

## Step B: [Setting up the open-liberty git repository and Eclipse workspace](OpenLiberty-Start-Step-B)

## Step C: [The Development Delivery Process](Delivery-Process)

After the completing the setup for the required software and for the git repositories and associated workspace above, you should be setup and ready to do development work.  From here you should proceed to the [Delivery Process](Delivery-Process) page to create a branch, change code, perform builds, and create a pull request.
